# TicTacToe_AI

This repository contains code for a terminal-based TicTacToe game with human and computer players. 

There are multiple computer players, namely:
  - a Random player (chooses field randomly)
  - a MiniMax player (uses the MiniMax algorithm to choose best field - not implemented fully)
  - a Q Player (uses Reinforced Learning to choose the best field)

Still to be implemented:
  - finish the MiniMax player
  - add win/lose/tie probability for each of the empty fields
